I created a class that can get NBA team and players statistics from https://www.basketball-reference.com/. With this class, you can get players' statistics from any year you choose. The tutorial on how I scrap is written on my medium at https://medium.com/@mraihanafiandi/scraping-basketball-reference-data-using-python-f321c3f2903e. You can also see the whole coding process in the notebook I've attached.
